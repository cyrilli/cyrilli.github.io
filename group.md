		<p>We develop intelligent decision-making methods for complex industrial systems, with a focus on machine learning, optimization, game theory, and simulation. Our goal is to create decision-making algorithms and pipelines that are both theoretically rigorous and effective in real-world industrial environments.</p>

<span style="color:red;"><strong>New</strong></span> Actively looking for postdoctoral researchers to join the group.

### What We Look For

We welcome **self-motivated, curious, and communicative** students who are excited about working on intelligent decision-making systems. Competitive candidates typically have:
- A strong foundation in **mathematics** and **programming**  
- Background or interest in **machine learning**, **reinforcement learning**, **operations research**, or related areas  
- A desire to conduct high-quality research that may span theory, algorithms, and real-world applications

### Especially Valued Expertise

Candidates with experience in one or more of the following areas are strongly encouraged to apply:
- **Domain expertise and hands-on experience in industrial and operational systems**, including manufacturing, supply chains, logistics, and warehousing, with demonstrated use of discrete-event simulation for system modeling, experimentation, and performance analysis.  
- **Proven experience designing, training, and evaluating deep learning models**, including large language models, using frameworks such as PyTorch and established LLM training and fine-tuning toolchains.  
- **Theoretical foundations in reinforcement learning, optimization, and game theory**, with demonstrated ability to analyze theoretical guarantees of learning and decision-making algorithms, including regret bounds, convergence properties, and equilibrium analysis.
