# Multi-agent INdustrial Decision-making System (MINDS) Lab
("*MINDS*" comes from **M**ulti-agent **IN**dustrial **D**ecision-making **S**ystem)

We develop intelligent decision-making methods for complex industrial systems, with a focus on machine learning, optimization, game theory, and simulation. Our goal is to create decision-making algorithms and pipelines that are both theoretically rigorous and effective in real-world industrial environments.

## Prospective Students

I recruit **Ph.D. students**, **Master’s students**, and **Undergraduate Research Assistants** on a yearly basis.  
If you are interested in joining the lab, please email your **CV** to **chuanhao-li {at} tsinghua.edu.cn**.

### What We Look For

We welcome **self-motivated, curious, and communicative** students who are excited about working on intelligent decision-making systems. Competitive candidates typically have:

- A strong foundation in **mathematics** and **programming**  
- Background or interest in **machine learning**, **reinforcement learning**, **operations research**, or related areas  
- A desire to conduct high-quality research that may span theory, algorithms, and real-world applications

### Especially Valued Expertise

Candidates with any of the following experience are particularly encouraged to apply:

- **Discrete-event simulation** for industrial systems (manufacturing, supply chain, warehouse, etc.), including experience with tools such as SimPy or xDEVS, and optionally Godot or similar game engines for creating animations or interactive visualizations of simulation models
- Experience with **LLM agent frameworks** or **post-training** (e.g., smolagents, RLHF, GRPO)
- Knowledge of **reinforcement learning**, **planning**, or **optimization** techniques for decision-making in dynamic systems
