		<p>We develop intelligent decision-making methods for complex industrial systems, with a focus on machine learning, optimization, game theory, and simulation. Our goal is to create decision-making algorithms and pipelines that are both theoretically rigorous and effective in real-world industrial environments.</p>

## Prospective Students

I recruit **Ph.D. students**, **Master’s students**, and **Undergraduate Research Assistants** on a yearly basis.  
If you are interested in joining the lab, please email your **CV** to **chuanhao-li {at} tsinghua.edu.cn**.

### What We Look For

We welcome **self-motivated, curious, and communicative** students who are excited about working on intelligent decision-making systems. Competitive candidates typically have:

- A strong foundation in **mathematics** and **programming**  
- Background or interest in **machine learning**, **reinforcement learning**, **operations research**, or related areas  
- A desire to conduct high-quality research that may span theory, algorithms, and real-world applications

### Especially Valued Expertise

Candidates with any of the following experience are particularly encouraged to apply:

- **Discrete-event simulation** for industrial systems (manufacturing, supply chain, warehouse, etc.), including experience with tools such as [SimPy](https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [salabim](https://github.com/salabim/salabim), or [xDEVS](https://github.com/iscar-ucm/xdevs), and optionally Godot or similar game engines for creating animations or interactive visualizations of simulation models
- Experience with **LLM agent frameworks** and **post-training** (e.g., RLHF, GRPO)
- Knowledge of **reinforcement learning**, **planning**, or **optimization** techniques for decision-making in dynamic systems
