<!-- I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/). My advisor is [Aidong Zhang](https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/aidong-zhang). 
Before joining UVa, I received my Bachelor degree in Mechanical Engineering and Master degree in Mechatronics Engineering from [Harbin Institute of Technology](http://en.hit.edu.cn/) in 2016 and 2018, respectively, where I worked on machine learning for prognostic health monitoring and robotics. -->



## **Research Interest**
<p style="padding-left: 35px;">I am broadly interested in Machine Learning and Data Mining. In particular, my current research mainly focuses on Multimodal Machine Learning, Vision & Language, Few-shot Learning, Meta-Learning, and Graph Mining. I am also interested in AI-guided Computer Graphics and AR/VR.</p>
