## **About Me**
<p style="padding-left: 35px;"> I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.virginia.edu/">University of Virginia</a> under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/aidong-zhang"> Aidong Zhang</a>. My research interests broadly are Machine Learning and Data Mining. In particular, my research areas are currently in multimodal machine learning, knowledge-guided learning, graph mining, and meta learning.  <!-- differencial privacy, and reinforcement learning --> Before joining UVa, I received my Bachelor degree in Automation Engineering and Master's degree in Control Science and Engineering (Pattern Recognition and Intelligent Systems) from <a href="http://en.hit.edu.cn/">Xi'an Jiaotong University</a> in 2015 and 2018, respectively, where I worked on computer vision and machine learning for computer graphics and robotics. 
I am also interested in AI-guided computer graphics and Smart AR/VR systems.</p>
