## About Me
I am a Postdoctoral Associate in the Department of Statistics & Data Science at Yale University, working with Professor Zhuoran Yang and Professor Dirk Bergemann. I obtained my PhD degree in Computer Science from University of Virginia, advised by Professor Hongning Wang.
<!--my bachelor's and master's degree from the School of Mechatronics Engineering at Harbin Institute of Technology.-->

## Research Interest
I am broadly interested in machine learning, decision making and algorithmic game theory.
Main focus of my research include: 1) LLM agents in single-agent and multi-agent decision making problems; 2) collaborative multi-agent contextual bandits, with consideration of task heterogeneity, non-stationary reward distribution, communication efficiency in distributed system, and incentive mechanism for collaboration; 3) non-cooperative games modeling competition among content creators on recommendation platforms.
