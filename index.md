## About
I am a Tenure-Track Assistant Professor in the Department of Industrial Engineering at Tsinghua University. Prior to joining Tsinghua, I was a Postdoctoral Associate in the Department of Statistics and Data Science at Yale University, where I was also affiliated with the Center for Algorithms, Data, and Market Design (CADMY). I hold a doctoral degree in Computer Science from the University of Virginia, a master’s degree in Mechatronics Engineering, and bachelor’s degrees in Mechanical Engineering and English from Harbin Institute of Technology.

## Research Interest
I am interested in multi‑agent systems that reason, interact, and learn in dynamic and uncertain settings—whether the individual agents’ objectives are aligned or not. My work blends machine learning, optimization, and algorithmic game theory to create:
- communication‑efficient collaborative learning protocols that reduce sample and bandwidth costs,
- incentive‑compatible mechanisms that align self‑interested agents with system goals, and
- hierarchical decision architectures augmented with large language models, leveraging common-sense knowledge to interpret unstructured inputs and adapt to novel scenarios.

These methods enable robust, adaptive cooperative decision-making in multi-agent systems—such as recommender systems and cyber-physical systems—ensuring sample and communication efficiency, as well as incentive awareness, under unstructured conditions.
