## About Me
I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Computer Science at [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/), advised by Professor [Hongning Wang](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~hw5x/). 
I obtained my bachelor's and master's degree from the School of Mechatronics Engineering at [Harbin Institute of Technology](http://en.hit.edu.cn/), where I worked on prognostic health monitoring and robotics using machine learning methods.

## Research Interest
I am broadly interested in machine learning and decision making, with a special focus on online learning problems like contextual multi-armed bandits.
My current research interest is in designing provably efficient solutions to multi-agent contextual bandits, with consideration of collaborative learning, non-stationary reward distribution, privacy and communication efficiency under distributed setting.
