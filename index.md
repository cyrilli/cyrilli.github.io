I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/). My advisor is [Aidong Zhang](https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/aidong-zhang). 
Before joining UVa, I received my Bachelor degree in Mechanical Engineering and Master degree in Mechatronics Engineering from [Harbin Institute of Technology](http://en.hit.edu.cn/) in 2016 and 2018, respectively, where I worked on machine learning for prognostic health monitoring and robotics.

## **Research Interest**
I am broadly interested in machine learning / statistical learning methods and their applications to information retrieval and data mining. My current research focus is contextual bandits, e.g., with consideration of non-stationary reward distribution, collaborative learning, communication efficiency / privacy in distributed setting.
