## **About Me**
I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/), advised by Professor [Hongning Wang](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~hw5x/). My research focus is contextual bandits, with consideration of non-stationary reward distribution, collaborative learning, communication efficiency / privacy in distributed setting.
Before joining UVa, I received my Bachelor degree in Mechanical Engineering and Master degree in Mechatronics Engineering from [Harbin Institute of Technology](http://en.hit.edu.cn/), where I worked on machine learning for prognostic health monitoring and robotics.
