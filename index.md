## About Me
I am a Postdoctoral Associate in the Department of Statistics & Data Science at Yale University, working with Professor Zhuoran Yang.
I obtained my PhD degree in Computer Science from University of Virginia, advised by Professor Hongning Wang, my bachelor's and master's degree from the School of Mechatronics Engineering at Harbin Institute of Technology.

## Research Interest
I am broadly interested in machine learning and decision making, with a special focus on online learning problems like contextual multi-armed bandits.
My current research interest is in designing provably efficient solutions to multi-agent contextual bandits, with consideration of collaborative learning, non-stationary reward distribution, privacy and communication efficiency under distributed setting.
